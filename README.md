I am a long-time 3D graphics developer, with an interest in Common Lisp.

Some highlights:
- MIT mathematics degree
- developed some of the earliest 3D CG software for Symbolics Lisp Machines
- wrote animation software used in “Jurassic Park”
- software R&D lead on “Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within” movie
- senior software developer on “The Hobbit” films

Currently designing and developing 3D software in Common Lisp (CCL on MacOS) as an open-ended research project.

More info about the project at my blog: https://kaveh808.medium.com

UPDATE:

The software is now an open source project in the **kons-9** repo.
